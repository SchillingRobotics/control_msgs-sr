# Each trajectory point specifies either positions[, velocities[, accelerations]]
# or positions[, effort] for the trajectory to be executed.
# All specified values are in the same order as the joint names in JointTrajectory.msg.

# Single DOF joint positions for each joint relative to their "0" position.
# The units depend on the specific joint type: radians for revolute or
# continuous joints, and meters for prismatic joints.
float64 position

# The rate of change in position of each joint. Units are joint type dependent.
# Radians/second for revolute or continuous joints, and meters/second for
# prismatic joints.
float64 velocity

# Rate of change in velocity of each joint. Units are joint type dependent.
# Radians/second^2 for revolute or continuous joints, and meters/second^2 for
# prismatic joints.
float64 acceleration

# TODO(henrygerardmoore): remove effort since JTC doesn't support it
float64 effort

# Desired time from the trajectory start for each joint to arrive at this trajectory point.
